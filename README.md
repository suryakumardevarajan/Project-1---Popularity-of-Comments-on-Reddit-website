# Regression-to-find-the-Popularity-of-Comments-on-Reddit-website

In this project we’re going to apply machine learning algorithms on a dataset that is provided by reddit.com. The datasets have different features such as children, controversiality, is_root and text. Our task is to figure out a model that will predict the popularity of a comment. we’ll start by defining linear regression algorithms-closed form and gradient descent and compare the results by implementing them, considering different features and different parameters for each task. Our project is divided into three tasks: first, we will split our dataset into training, validation and test datasets and extract the desired features for every task. Then, we’ll be implementing the closed form and gradient descent algorithms. Finally, we’ll compare the results of these algorithms on the validation set to check the performance and stability of our models. Getting the best model that we have and running it on the test set will examine our trained model when it comes to unseen dataset. We found that the gradient descent approach was slower than the closed-form approach for the dataset provided and we analysed how decay plays a role in gradient descent
